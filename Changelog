1.5.0
-----
* Make tuning work on-the-fly instead of requiring up-front tuning
* Make the ABI robust against changes to OpenCL C++ bindings
* Add method overloads that take OpenCL C API handles
* Add free callback to setEventCallback functions
* Add support for arbitrary function objects to setEventCallback functions
* Allow algorithm objects to be default constructed, swapped, and moved
* Fix CLOGS_VERSION_MINOR

1.4.0
-----
* Reduction has been added
* Introduced the ScanProblem and RadixsortProblem classes
* The cache is now stored in a SQLite database instead of lots of files
* The cache is now located in an XDG-compliant location on UNIX (~/.cache/clogs by default).
* The tuning caching mechanism has been significantly rewritten for use with SQLite
* All kernels generated during tuning are now cached (this can use a lot of space)

1.3.0
-----
* Program binaries are now extracted during tuning and saved in the cache (see #8). This can also make tuning faster on systems that don't cache kernels.
* Out-of-place scan is now supported (partially implements #12).
* Workaround to avoid depending on OpenCL 1.2 ICD

1.2.4
-----
* Fix definition of WARP_VOLATILE (#28)

1.2.3
-----
* Fix a bug causing incorrect results when SCAN_BLOCKS is small (#26)
* Avoid building the unit test kernels except when testing (#24)
* Speed up tuning on CPU devices (#25)

1.2.2
-----
* Fix a race condition in radix sort (mostly affects CPU devices)
* Work around an AMD driver bug that caused segfaults in tuning
* Avoid passing defines with both -D and #define

1.2.1
-----
* Performance improvements, particularly for AMD GPUs
* Added --keep-going option to clogs-tune, as a temporary work-around for #23

1.2.0
-----
* Kernel parameters are now autotuned (refer to user manual)
* Added benchmark support for scan
* Fixed sorting in benchmark tool to support 3-element value types
* Improved robustness to non-default locale
* Added --split-debug and --variant=symbols configuration options

1.1.0
-----
* Add setEventCallback methods to Scan and Radixsort
* Worked around a bug in the Intel OpenCL compiler

1.0.3
-----
* Some minor tweaks to allow building on Windows with MSVC
* Allow build to complete (without tests) if CppUnit is missing

1.0.2
-----
* Fix a build system error that caused builds to fail when documentation was built from a pristine installation

1.0.1
-----
* Fix a packaging error that prevented installation from working when building docs

1.0.0
-----
* First public release
