Please refer to the user manual at http://clogs.sourceforge.net/doc/clogs-user.html
for instructions on compiling and installing clogs.

For the impatient, the process is

$ ./waf configure [ --prefix=install-path ]
$ ./waf build
$ sudo ./waf install
$ clogs-tune

which will build and install to the install path (defaults to /usr/local),
and which will install the documentation in /usr/local/share/doc/clogs
if you have xsltproc and doxygen installed.
